# Dog's breed predicting project

Development of a convolutional neural network to predict the dog's breed. The code accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.

Project built during the [Udacity deep learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

## Installation

#### User installation
You need to have the jupyter notebook installed, along with numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

    pip install jupyter

## Development
Contributions to the project are welcome. The idea was to train a lot of images of dogs and predict the dog's breed using convolutional neural network.
